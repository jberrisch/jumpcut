        <p>
           0.82 corrects two issues remaining from the 0.81 release and adds a couple additional
           small niceties.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Pressing ESC while the bezel is displayed now dismisses the bezel correctly.</li>
            <li>Users with two or more or monitors should see improved behavior, with Jumpcut now
                appearing on the monitor with keyboard focus. Thanks to Salmeen Majid for
                additional testing!</li>
            <li>The &quot;skipSave&quot; preference introduced in 0.81 now has an exposed checkbox
                with appropriate warnings.</li>
            <li>Double-clicking the icon while Jumpcut is running now opens the Preferences window
                regardless of whether the status bar icon is displayed, as a partial workaround to
                (non-Jumpcut-specific) issues regarding the the notch on recent laptops.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As always, please report any bugs or feature requests on GitHub. Thanks for using Jumpcut!</p>
